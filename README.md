- 👋 Hi, My name is Juan Manuel, but also I’m known as @jmpedrazalaley
- 👀 I’m interested in development and system integrations. My main tech stack is Microsoft's .net and Azure. As main programming language, C# is my choice to go. Also, I'm fairly versed in angular 8 with typescript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more C# (I can't get sharp enough, pun intended!), and I'm open to master JS, TS and learning other skills; specially related with mobile/desktop development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that helps me learn something new, but always according to the tech stack I handle.
- 📫 How to reach me? This is my company account. You can reach me both from this account or as @JackPanzer which is my personal github account.
